The following set of code uses all 4 switches on the top board. To run the
code on the msp430 you have to be in the shape-motion-demo directory,
to execute the program you have to run the command

make load


This will display three different shapes. A red square, orange circle, and
smaller violet circle. When switch 1 is held the shapes will move, if the switch
is not held the shapes will remain whenever they left off before the switch
was not pressed.

Switch 2 will display a filled diamond.

Switch 3 will display four lines to form a star.

Switch 4 will display a joke with different text fonts and sizes.

You are able to switch between switches at any time.
